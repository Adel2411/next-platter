# Next-Platter: Next.js Project Scaffolding CLI

Welcome to **Next-Platter**, a CLI tool designed to streamline the creation of new Next.js projects with pre-configured templates.

---

## **What is Next-Platter?**

**Next-Platter** is your go-to CLI tool for generating Next.js project templates. Think of it as a **plate** of templates üçΩÔ∏è you can pick from, allowing you to quickly scaffold your Next.js project with minimal setup and best practices already in place.

---

## **Purpose**

The main goal of **Next-Platter** is to eliminate the repetitive setup tasks when starting new Next.js projects. Instead of manually configuring tools like Tailwind CSS, TypeScript or Cypress, you can rely on **Next-Platter** to provide templates with everything set up for you.

---

## **Key Features**

- **Multiple Templates** for different project needs.
- **Quick Setup** with pre-configured tools and best practices.
- **Customizable** templates that grow with your project.
- **Lightweight Tooling** focused on essential features without bloat.

2. **Using `npx`**:

   - Run the following command to create a new project using this template:

     ```

   cd my-app
   ```
